Rainbow Simon 
================

My take on the classic Simon game - upated for the 21st Century. Featuring modernised, mobile-friendly User Interface, simple tutorials and additional challenges offered by the variable difficulty level which increments the number of potential options and the target score - ensuring more replayability than the classic. 

UX
------------------------

The game is designed to be straightforward to grasp and engaging. Simplicity is built into the design - there are very few controls and little room for confusion.

* The tutorial is a single page with only three simple instructions to grasp.
* On the tutorial page there is also a selector which will allow them to select a difficulty level. By default this is set to Standard which will have four different colours (like the classic game) but it can be any number between 2 and 6. 
* The difficulty level also affects the target score the user is trying to achieve. From 5 on Very Easy difficulty to 30 on Very Hard difficulty this ensures that the challenge is variable.
* After the tutorial and difficulty selector there is a large simple button which will remove the Tutorial page and launch the game. As soon as this button is clicked it will start by selecting from the available colours and clicking on it. It will then await the users input.
* The users input is to click on the colourful buttons, there are no other controls. 
* The game repeats as such until the user either achieves the target score or makes an error, at which point a pop-up will appear to let them know and invite them to try again.

As part of this design process I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to structure the layout of the site and the individual pages.

User Stories

* John is 60, he played Simon as a child and would love to recreate that feeling

Features
------------------

### Current Features

* Functional Game which is instantly recognisable to fans of the classic.
* Variable difficulty level allowing for all levels of player.
* From 2 - 6 different colours which could be added to the session.
* Target scores from 5 - 25 to ensure that casual and competitive gamers are engaged.


### Potential Features

* Allowing for separate selection for each of "Number of Colours" and "Target Score"
* "Legendary Difficulty level which would speed up the iteration or alter the colours to make it exceptionally challenging.
* Multiplayer support allowing people to play the game remotely - where one player will take half the colours and the other the other half, further increasing difficulty and engagement.

Deployment
-------------------


The site is deployed [here](geminerald.github.io/simon-game "Rainbow Simon page on GitHub Pages").

After the site was close to it's final stage it was deployed to GitHub Pages in order to allow for more available real world testing with a variety of users. 

Development continued, pushing to master branch once I was confident in the code used would increase functionality or users experience.
