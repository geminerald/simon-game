Rainbow Simon 
================

My take on the classic Simon game - upated for the 21st Century. Featuring modernised, app-friendly User Interface, simple tutorials and additional challenges offered by the variable difficulty level which increments the number of potential options and the target score - ensuring more replayability than the classic. 

UX
------------------------

The game is designed to be straightforward to grasp and engaging. Simplicity is built into the design - there are very few controls and little room for confusion.

* A User can be directed to the page in a variety of ways, including online search or by the user's social media channels.
* Once there they are presented with an inspirational message and directed to the Services page with a button to 'begin their journey' - alternatively they have the full options available to them on the Nav bar if they have visited before or know what they are looking for.
* On the Services page they are shown the basic services offered and directed to Book Now - this button will take them to the Contact page where they can contact the client to book an appointment.
* If they are browsing various options they can view the pricelist page from any page using the nav link at the top of all pages, this will take them to the prices page which will give them a more detailed breakdown of all the times and services available.

As part of this design process I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to structure the layout of the site and the individual pages.

* John is 60, he played Simon as a child and would love to recreate that feeling

Features
------------------

### Current Features

* Functional Game which is instantly recognisable to fans of the classic.
* Variable difficulty level allowing for all levels of player.
* From 2 - 6 different colours which could be added to the session.
* Target scores from 5 - 25 to ensure that casual and competitive gamers are engaged.


### Potential Features

* Allowing for separate selection for each of "Number of Colours" and "Target Score"
* "Legendary Difficulty level which would speed up the iteration or alter the colours to make it exceptionally challenging.
* Multiplayer support allowing people to play the game remotely - where one player will take half the colours and the other the other half, further increasing difficulty and engagement. 

Technologies Used
------------

* HTML - Used for all content.
* CSS - Used for all layout and styles.
* jQuery - Used to allow for special click events.
* JavaScript - Used to create the functions powering the game.


Testing
--------------

I tested the functionality of the game myself manually throughout the development, ensuring that features were working before moving on or pushing them.

Deployment
-------------------


The site is deployed [here](geminerald.github.io/simon-game "Rainbow Simon page on GitHub Pages").

After the site was close to it's final stage it was deployed to GitHub Pages in order to allow for more available real world testing with a variety of users. 

Development continued, pushing to master branch once I was confident in the code used would increase functionality or users experience.
